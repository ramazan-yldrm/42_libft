# libft

This project is part of the 42 curriculum.  
The goal of **libft** is to recreate a personal C library by re-implementing standard libc functions and adding useful utility functions.

## 📌 Description

libft is a static library written in **C**.  
It contains commonly used functions that can be reused in future projects.

This project helps to:
- Understand how standard C functions work internally
- Improve memory management skills
- Write clean and reusable code
